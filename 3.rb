# Functional Objects
























# SOLID
#
# Single Responsibility Principle
# Open/Close Principle
# Liskov Substitution Principle
# Interface Segregation
# Dependency Inversion

# Functions in Ruby
#
# You're guided towards doing a single thing
# To add new functionality you create more functions
# Each function could theoretically be substutited
# The interface is small
# For "pure" functions they have no knowledge of anything outside
